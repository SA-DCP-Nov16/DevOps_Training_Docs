	Kubernetes ::::
	
		- It is a Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool 
		- Kubernetes is used to Deploy any type of Containers.
		- It is used to ensure high availability of the Applications/services running thru Containers.
		- Used to Ensure High Availability of Containers by creating Replicas of Containers.
		- It supports Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing.
		- Self-Healing

		pod 		==> It is a Atomic Unit of Task/schedule in Kubernetes.
						It is term used to refer the container in kubernetes
		Container Registry 
		Kubernetes Cluster ==> It is collection of workernodes.

Master Components

Below are the main components on the Kubernetes master node:

etcd cluster – a simple, distributed key value storage which is used to store the Kubernetes cluster data (such as number of pods, their state, namespace, etc), API objects and service discovery details. It is only accessible from the API server for security reasons. 

kube-apiserver – Kubernetes API server is the central management entity that receives all REST requests for modifications (to pods, services, replication sets/controllers and others), serving as frontend to the cluster. 
Also, this is the only component that communicates with the etcd cluster, making sure data is stored in etcd and agrees with the service details of the deployed pods.

kube-controller-manager – runs several distinct controller processes in the background (for example, replication controller controls number of replicas in a pod, endpoints controller populates endpoint objects like services and pods, and others) to regulate the shared state of the cluster and perform routine tasks. 

cloud-controller-manager – is responsible for managing controller processes with dependencies on the underlying cloud provider (if applicable). For example, when a controller needs to check if a node was terminated or set up routes, load balancers or volumes in the cloud infrastructure, all that is handled by the cloud-controller-manager.

kube-scheduler – helps schedule the pods (a co-located group of containers inside which our application processes are running) on the various nodes based on resource utilization. It reads the service’s operational requirements and schedules it on the best fit node. 




Node (worker) components

Below are the main components found on a (worker) node:

kubelet – the main service on a node, regularly taking in new or modified pod specifications (primarily through the kube-apiserver) and ensuring that pods and their containers are healthy and running in the desired state. This component also reports to the master on the health of the host where it is running.

kube-proxy – a proxy service that runs on each worker node to deal with individual host subnetting and expose services to the external world. It performs request forwarding to the correct pods/containers across the various isolated networks in a cluster.


Managed Kubernetes Services :::

AWS 	: ECS,ECR,EKS

AZURE 	: ACS,ACR,AKS 

GCP 	: GCS,GCR,GKS

Installation & Configuration of Kubernetes Master and WorkNodes

	- MiniKube 		==> Lightweight version of Kubernetes - Just of limited no. of Deployment / Learning purpose.
	
	- Kubeadm		==> Utility to create/Manage the Kubernetes installation and configurations



Installation & Configuration of Kubernetes Master and WorkNodes:::

		Kubernetes_Master(VM)
			Kubernetes_WorkerNode1(VM)
			Kubernetes_WorkerNode2(VM)
		
		
		1. Launch the required no. of VMs (1+2) 
		2. Open all the required ports 
		
		Commands to be executed in all the Nodes (Master & WorkerNodes)
			3. Define a Unique Host Name for each Node 
			4. Install Docker 
			5. Install ContainerD  # CRI
			6. Install Kubeadm,kubelet,kubectl
			7. Disable Swap 		
			
		Commands to be executed only in Master Node

			8. kubeadm init 		# Initialize Kubernetes Master 
			9. Install Network Plugins for Kube-Proxy

			
		Commands to be executed only in Worker Nodes

			10. kubeadm join 		# To join the Worknodes with Master

		Terminologies :::
		
			kubectl 		# Command Line Utility used to interact with Kubernetes 
			kubeadm 		# It is used to Initialize / Config the Kubernetes_Master & Cluster 
			Kubernetes_Cluster 	# It is Collection K8s WorkerNodes 
			pods 		
			
		Working with Pods 
		Deployments 
		Services 
		Namespaces 
		Hostpath Volumes 	

			Tomcat(8080)/Nginx(80) ???

		Working with Pods ::

			Manifest file --> *.yaml Script.
			
			Yaml Scripts are Declarative Scripts
					key:value pair
					
			Create and work with pods using Kubectl.


			Kubernetes Namespaces are logical partitioning of the Cluster.
			
			Create Pods ::
				Write a Manifest File. - *.yaml
