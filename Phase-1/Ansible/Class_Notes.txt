		IAC Tools ==> 	Infra-Structure As Code 
							- Write the code to automate the infrastructure provisioning and Configuration
							- Declarative Scripts 
							- *.yaml Scripts / HCL Scripts 
		
			Provision/Creating the servers		==> Terraform / Cloudformation / RMs
				
			Configure the servers		- CMS	==> Configuration Management System - Install/Unstall/Upgrade
												==> Ansible / chef / puppet 
		
			

			Ansible 	==> *.yaml Scripts 
			
			Terraform 	==> HCL Language - Hashi-Corp declarative Language (*.json)

		Ansible ::
		
			Ansible Architecture 
			
			Components of Ansible Architecture 
			
				Inventory File 			# Used to maintain the details of the target nodes 
				Modules 				# Used to execute some task in Target Node 
				ansible.config 			# Is used to maintain the Default properties of Ansible in Ansible Controller 
				
				Ansible Controller & Ansible Target Nodes 
			
			Terminologies 
			
				How to access the target nodes from Ansible Controller ???
				
				SSH --> Handling SSH Keys - Enable Key Based Authentication
				
				Ansible Adhoc Command		==>  	Used to quickly execute a Module/Task in the target node(s)
													Cannot be reusable 
							apt install git -y
							
				Ansible Playbooks 			==> Used to execute some series of modules/Tasks in the target node(s)
							apt install git -y
							apt install jdk 
							apt install maven 
							
						Playbooks are written using *.yaml scripts
						Playbooks are reusable

1. Jenkins Slave Nodes - why we need it ? 

2. Sir how to get t2.micro in instance type, because in my system windows 11 t2.micro is not coming? Can you show a demo how to get it , as its not available, and not coming in remaining options also

		3. Sir, when I used open-jdk-17, your mvn-hello-world was not getting packaged...
But using open-jdk-11 it is getting packaged (mvn clean package)
On Jenkins it is showing a notification jdk-11 will be outdated by sept 30, What will be the solution? Or will developers take care of the necessary plugins??

Meaning and use of Plugins ???

Deployment Object Concepts 

I Understand the Jenkins Pipeline / Module. Maven/Tomcat.   But the thing is ==> In real time Scenario Will use tomcat server anywhere.

Sir show how to use git on Ec2 - ubuntu, we know how to use it on local machine but on a VM some things can be tricky

		local machine -- git bash 
	Linux - ubuntu 	
		mkdir projects 
		mkdir repo1
		git init 
		git clone <url>
	
	
	Local Machine :: appln_repo1   --> AWS EC2 
	
		from local machine - git push appln_repo1 to github 
	
		from aws ec2 instance - git clone appln_repo1 from github 
		

Sir for doing ubuntu linux assignment 1st question in AWS, can we use git bash for support, I mean to bring ubuntu into existence through aws by using git bash?

			
			
	explain deployemnet concepts sir
	
	In Slave_Node ???
	Slave_Node1 == app team 1 ---> jdk11 
	
	Slave_Node2 == app team 2 ---> jdk17 
	
	
	Containarization !!!
	
		
			Infra-Structure Perspective ::
			
				Jenkins_Master(VM) : 	- create the job & Schedule the jobs
				

				: Ruby - To build the application and create artifacts
			

			Containerization :::
			
				Jenkins_Master : Jenkins uses the plugins to interact with the tools 
					
					Jenkin_Slave - (VM)(EC2):
						Container Engine 
							C1	Java - 			Maven is used to build 
							C2  Python 
							C3  .Net - 
							C4  Angular
							C5  Node - 
						    C6  Ruby - 
							C7 Jdk11
							C8 Jdk17	
							
							
			Create Container Image 
			Push the image to Container Registry 
			pull the image to any target node 
	

		Why we need Containers ???
		
		Docker is used to create and push the images to container Registry 
		
		Kubernetes ==> Deploy that container image in the target environment 

	
		

			mywebapp.war_v1.0
			mywebapp.war_v1.1
			mywebapp.war_v1.2
			mywebapp.war_v1.3
		
			mywebapp_image:v1.0
			mywebapp_image:v1.1
			mywebapp_image
		
			Micro-service - 
			
			3-tier 
			
In portmapping we are giving port number to that host, but in real time do we need to give port number in our own are did management will give?
				
		
	sir ,if MS is 3 tier how can maven create separate package  , one for *.java (business logic) and another for resouces (.html,css,jsp)

	
	
	Kubernetes Services ::
	
		Nodeport  pod --> expose to internet --> nodeport service
		
		clusterIp Service 
		
		Load Balancer 
			
			
			front_end-Pod(x.x.x.x) 						Backend-pod(y.y.y.y)
			
			
		Flannel Network Plugin :::
		
		K8s Architecture :::
		
			Kube Proxy ==> used to perform networking 
			
			pod --> ip address. (10.244.0.0) - flannel/calico network plugin
		
		
		Port Mapping :::: 
		
		docker run -it -p 8081:8080 tomcat:8.0 ???????
		
		docker run -it centos 
	
	
	
		Ansible Installion.
