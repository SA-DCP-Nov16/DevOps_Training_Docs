DevOps Overview :::

	DevOps :::
	
	Waterfall & Agile Method ??
	
	Stages of DevOps ????
	
	DevOps ::::
	
		- Software --> 
		
			- Application Software 
					--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system
					--> Web Applications       --> ECommerce, Online Banking 
					--> Mobile Applications	   --> Mobile Apps
			- System  Software 
			
		SDLC -> Software Development Life Cycle :::
		
				--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system
				
			- Requirement Analysis 
			- Design 
			- Coding / Development
			- Testing 
			- Implementation 
			- Maintainence/Monitoring
			
		1. Waterfall Model ::: - 	Linear in approach
									It strictly follows top down approach
									It is meant for Monolith Application Architecture
				
				--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system BASIC / COBOL 
					Billing Application :
						- Inventory Mgmt
						- Price Mgmt
						- User-Interface - CLI
						- Order placement 
						- Payment 
							
				Project 1:		
					- Requirement Analysis 		==> 9 months to complete this project.
					- Design 
					- Coding / Development			mid of 4th Month 
					- Testing 
					- Implementation 
					- Maintainence/Monitoring		
					
				Project 2:		
					- Requirement Analysis 		==> 
					- Design 
					- Coding / Development			
					- Testing 
					- Implementation 
					- Maintainence/Monitoring	

				
				
				Tele-comm Domain :: 
					SP1 --> Introduce a new offer to their customers 
							-> IT Team to implement this ASAP
					SP2 --> 
					
		2. Agile Methodology :::
		
				--> Desktops Applications  --> Billing system BASIC / COBOL 
				
					Billing Application :
						Functions/Modules/Iterations
							- Inventory Mgmt
							- Price Mgmt
							- User-Interface - CLI
							- Order placement 
							- Cash-Payment
							- Online-payment
													
			Iterations 1:  Inventory Mgmt
				- Requirement Analysis 
				- Design 
				- Coding / Development
				- Testing 
				- Implementation*** 
				- Maintainence/Monitoring***	
		
			Iterations 2:  - Price Mgmt
				- Requirement Analysis 
				- Design 
				- Coding / Development
				- Testing 
				- Implementation*** 
				- Maintainence/Monitoring***		
	
			Iterations n:  - Online-payment
				- Requirement Analysis 
				- Design 
				- Coding / Development
				- Testing 
				- Implementation*** 
				- Maintainence/Monitoring***
				
			Using Agile Methodologies we can able to achieve :::
					Continous Development 
					Continous Integration
					Continous Testing 
					Continous Delivery  to Production
								- This Expect Manual approval for Production Release.
			But we cannot achieve :::
					Continous Deployment to Production
								- This Doesnt expect any manual approval for Production Release. We can automate Production Release without any manual intervension.


		3. DevOps :::
		
			What is DevOps ????
			
				DevOps is a Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continous Development, Continous Integration, Continous Testing, Continous Delivery, Continous Deployment and Continous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
				
			
			Teams ::
			
				DevOps Team 
					1. Infra-Structure Management Team 
					2. Application Development Team 
					3. Testing Team
					4. Release Management Team 
					5. Production Support Team
					6. Production Monitoring Team
					7. Security Team
				
				
			Stages of DevOps ::
			
					Infra-Structure Management ::
							IAC - Ansible & Terraform 
							
					Continous Development ::
						- It is capability of Application Development to continously develop the code.
						- Increase the productivity of Developers.
						Developer --> Role of developer ???
							Coding the Business Application.
							- Create source code 
							- Manually build the code 
							- Create Artifacts
							- Manually perform unit testing 
							- Promote the code to Testing Environments 
							- Notify the testing team to do further testing
							
						Using DevOps Approach :::
							- Create source code Update the code in a source code repository 
							
						DevOps take the responsibility : 
							- Automate build the code 
									Application Build :
										It is process of compiling the source code and creating artifacts.
										Artifacts are - Binaries (*.war,*.jar,*.exec,*.dll)										
							- Automate Create Artifacts
							- Automated unit testing 
							- Automate Promote the code to Testing Environments 
							- Automate the Notification - Notify the testing team to do further testing
					
						Tools : 
							Eclipse based IDEs(Integrated Development Environment) - Eclipse, Pycharm, Intellij
						DevOps Tools ::
							GIT, Jenkins, Build Tools(Maven,JUnit)
							
					Continous Integration ::
						- It is capability of Application Development to continously integrate their code change for further testing without waiting for any dependencies.
						
						Tools ::
							- Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes 
						
					Continous Testing ::
						- To enable Automated Testing ::
						- QA Testing
						- UAT Testing 
						
						Tools ::
							- Jenkins, Junit/TestNG/Selenium 						
						
					Continous Delivery  & Continous Deployment
					
						Tools : Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes 
					
						- Both are related to Production Release :
						
						Continous Delivery : 					Continous Delivery  to Production
								- This Expect Manual approval for Production Release.						

								Banking Application :
									Online Banking :::
										release new feature  to Production Environment:::
										
										Open a Production Deployment Window :: (4 - 6 Hrs) - Non-Business Hours
											Take manual approval from all stake holders for this release 
											Thorough Testing in Production Environment.
												If anything goes wrong :
													Fix the Issue. 
													Revert
									
						Continous Deployment :	
								- Can be achieved with the matured DevOps Strategies/Process.
								- This Doesnt expect any manual approval for Production Release. We can automate Production Release without any manual intervension.
								- No Downtime.

								Facebook 
								Netflix 
								amazon 
								google 							
							
					Continous Monitoring :
							
							- Mainly used to achieve Business Continuity.
							
							- Infra-Structure Monitoring
									Monitor the Production Servers -- Memory/CPU utilization & Traffic 
									
							Tools :: 
									Jenkins,Prometheus,Grafana,
									
							- Application Monitoring 
									AppDynamics

			Application Development & Deployment
			
			Application Architecture 
			
				SDLC Perspective :
				
					1. Monolith Application Architecture :
						- It is a tightly coupled Application Architecture
						- It is difficult to Add More features quickly
						- All the Application Dependencies are closely couple with each other.
						
					Billing Application :
						Functions/Modules/Iterations
							- Inventory Mgmt
							- Price Mgmt
							- User-Interface - CLI
							- Order placement 
							- Cash-Payment
							- Online-payment		

					2. Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :
						- A smallest unit of task
						- It is loosely coupled application 
						- It allows the developers to independently develop, test, and develop the changes to production.
						- Eleminate all the dependencies and enable independent development and implementation.

			Linux File Management 
				
				create dir/
				create/update/delete/read ==> file
				
				Misc. Shell Commands for file handling!

					Create the directory :
						mkdir 
					
					Create a file :
						touch <file_name>						# used to create empty file 
						echo "record" >> <file_name>			# used to create file with contents 
						echo "record" > <file_name>				# used to replace the existing records 
						echo "record" 							# to prind the message.
						
						Using vi Editor 						# default file editor in Linux 
							vim/nano 
							
						vi <file_name> 							# Used to Edit the file.
						
						press i 								# get into insert mode .
						esc :wq 								# used to save the file and exit 
						ecs :q!									# used to exit the file without saving the changes.
						
					copy the files from one dir to another 
					
						cp <file_name> dir1/
							cp /home/ubuntu/nov27/file1.txt /home/ubuntu/dir1/	# Execute this from different location
							
							cp file1.txt /home/ubuntu/folder1					# Execute this from the file location
							
							wildcard symbols :
							
							cp *.* /home/ubuntu/folder1
							
							cp *.java /home/ubuntu/folder1
							
							cp file1.txt,file2.java /home/ubuntu/folder1
							
					
					move the files from one dir to another
						mv <file_name> dir1/
						
							mv  /home/ubuntu/nov27/file1.txt /home/ubuntu/dir1/	# Execute this from different location
							
							mv file1.txt /home/ubuntu/folder1					# Execute this from the file location
							
							wildcard symbols :
							
							mv *.* /home/ubuntu/folder1
							
							mv *.java /home/ubuntu/folder1						
						
						
					rename the file :::
					
							mv file1.txt newfile1.txt
							
					
					
					$ ll
					
					
					----------
					drwxrwxrwx			==> access level.
					-rwxrwxrwx		
							
							
							
					Owner 			of the file 
					
					Access Mode 	of the file 
			
					ubuntu 
					root 
					
					
					dev_team			group 1
						user1
						user2
						user3 
						
					test_team			group 2
						user4
						user5
						user6 
						user3
					
					user7	
					user8 
					user9 
						
					file1.txt ==> user1(owner) 			https://chmod-calculator.com/
					
					chmod 755 file1.sh
					
					-rw-rw-r--						# Default access mode.
					
					-rwxr-----
					
					-rwx--x--x						
					

					-rwx   		==> read,write,execute ==> Owner
						
					-rwxr--		==> Users part of the group can able to just read the file 
					
					-rwxr--r--  ==> Public users can able to just read the file
					
					
					How to customize the Access Mode :::
					
					chmod 
						
						
					rm <file_name>				# remove the file 
					
					rm -f <file_name>			# force remove the file
					
					rm -rf <dir_name>			# force remove the directory will all its sub-elements.(recursive)
					
					
					
					
					----------
	                
					-						==> Denotes the type of the object (file/dir)
					
					  ---					===> Owner level access 					  
						 ---				===> The group level access 
						    ---				===> The public user access 
					
					 ---					==> denotes the access level of the owner - read,write,execute
					 
					users and groups???
					
					dir/
					
						
				    -rwxrwxrwx	
					
					
			User Management::
				
					- Create and Manage the Linux users.
					- Create/Set Authentication for that user.
									Password Authentication
									Key Based Authentication
									
									
					- User Authentication & Authorization 
					- Authentication	==> Denotes Who can Access ?
					- Authorization		==> Denotes What can Accessible ?
					
					Linux : ubuntu and root 
					
					Eg. for Authentication ::
						both these users are authenticated to login to this Linux box.
						
					Eg. for Authorization ::
						Whether ubuntu user can able access /root dir?			NO 
						Whether root user can able access /home/ubuntu dir?		YES
						
				User Add Command to create users in Linux :::

					cat /etc/passwd 					# get the list of users in Linu Machines.
														# In windows Machine c:/users/
					
					cat /etc/group						# get the list of user-groups.

					useradd devopsuser1
							In Centos/RHEL, It create user_name,user's home directory, and default bash prompt
							In Ubuntu, It creates only the user_name 
							

					useradd -m -d /home/devopsuser1 devopsuser1
					
					
					In Ubuntu Machines ::: ******
					
						useradd devopsadmin -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devopsadmin
					
					su - devopsuser1 				# to login to that user.
